# MagicSquareCheck
This program in the language C++ takes in a .txt file and checks if the square given is a magic square based on the criteria of magic squares

In a magic square, there is a magic sum that is calculated by the equation n[(n^2+1)/2]

With the sum the is created from the equation, the program would check if the elements of the square go from n to n^2 and that each element is unique from one another. Then if the square passes that crietria then the program will check if the rows, collums, and diagnials sum all equal to the magic sum calculated earlier.

The program itself is inefficent, but it is to see if I understood #fstream and #vectors executed in a small program. The program itself also pauses the system as way for the user to see each square and the outcome of the square and to tell the user when it hit the end of the text file.
